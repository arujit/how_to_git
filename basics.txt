git init : for initializing the git repository in your pc

git status : checking the status of the repository that is what are the untracked files  , changes , etc.


staged: Files are ready to be committed.

unstaged:Files with changes that have not been prepared to be  committed.

untracked:Files aren't tracked by Git yet. This usually indicates a  newly created file.

deleted:  File has been deleted and is waiting to be removed from Git.

add all: You can also type git add -A . where the dot stands for the current directory, so everything in and beneath it is added. 		The -A ensures even file deletions are included.

git reset: You can use git reset <filename> to remove a file or files from the staging area.

Commit : A "commit" is a snapshot of our repository. This way if we ever need to look back at the changes we've made (or if someone else 		does), we will see a nice timeline of all  changes. 

git add filename : add that file/s to the staging area.

git commit -m " your message"  : commits all the staed files

git log : check all the commits , also git log --summary can be used

git remote add "name" "url of repository"  : here name = orgin and url is the url of the repository
